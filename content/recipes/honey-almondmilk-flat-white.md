## Ingredients

### Honey Syrup

- 1 cup honey
- 1 cup water

#### Honey Almondmilk Flat White

- 2 shots Espresso
- 1 cup unsweetened almondmilk
- 1 ounce honey syrup

## Instructions

### Honey Syrup

Combine 1 cup of honey and 1 cup of water in a small pot on the stove over medium heat until lightly simmering.

Let simmer for 5–7 minutes while stirring occasionally.

Remove from heat and let cool for 20–30 minutes. You can store your honey syrup in the fridge for up to 7 days.

### Honey Almondmilk Flat White

Brew your coffee as you normally would. Starbucks recommends 2 shots of Espresso.

Add 1 oz of honey syrup to the mug and stir.

Froth almondmilk using your preferred method. As you froth your milk, try using a spoon to gently push the microbubbles to the bottom of the pitcher. This will result in a smoother, more velvety texture for your flat white.

Gently pour your frothed milk into your mug until it’s almost full, then focus on the middle of your mug and pour a little faster so the foam will come out without moving your pitcher. As the foam starts to come out, continue to pour until you get a dot in the middle.
