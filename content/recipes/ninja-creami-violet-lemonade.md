## Ingredients

- 1/3 cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice
- 1/2 cup violet syrup (I used Le Sirop de Monin brand)
- 1 1/4 cups water
- Optional: 2-3 drops of purple food coloring

## Instructions

1. In a small bowl or large liquid measuring cup, combine lemon juice, violet syrup, and water. Stir to combine.
1. If using, add food coloring and stir.
1. Pour mixture into a Ninja Creami pint container, being careful not to exceed the max fill line, and close the lid. Place on a level surface in the freezer and freeze for at least 24 hours.
1. Remove pint from the freezer and take off the lid. Place pint into the outer bowl apparatus and secure the outer bowl lid.
1. Place outer bowl apparatus into the Ninja Creami machine and lock into place. Press the Sorbet button and allow the cycle to complete.
1. Remove the pint and check the consistency of the sorbet. If it appears crumbly, reinsert it into the machine and press the Re-spin button to process again.

## Notes

- Some models of Ninja Creami machines have an Italian Ice function, but mine does not. I use the sorbet function, but I imagine the Italian Ice function would work just fine if you have that on your machine.
- Feel free to adjust the sweetness if you need to, by adding a bit more syrup.
- I use Le Sirop de Monin brand violet syrup, which you can get [here on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3KVVlf2).
