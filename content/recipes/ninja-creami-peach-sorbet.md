## Ingredients

- 15.25-oz can diced peaches in heavy syrup
- Optional: 1-2 tablespoons of sugar, maple syrup, or sweetener of choice

## Instructions

1. Pour diced peaches and their liquid into a Ninja Creami pint container, being careful not to exceed the max fill line.
1. If desired, add 1-2 tablespoons of sweetener to the mixture, stirring to combine. Keep in mind that the mixture will be slightly less sweet after freezing, so taste and adjust accordingly.
1. Close lid on the pint container and transfer to a level surface in your freezer. Freeze for at least 24 hours.
1. Remove pint from freezer and take off lid. Place pint into the outer bowl and secure the outer bowl lid.
1. Place bowl apparatus into Ninja Creami machine and lock into place.
1. Press the Sorbet button and allow the cycle to complete.
1. Remove the pint and check the texture of the sorbet. If it appears crumbly, insert the pint back into the machine and use the Re-spin button to process it again. If it's still crumbly after that, add a tablespoon of water or juice and Re-spin again.
1. Scoop, serve, and enjoy!

## Notes

- You can adjust the sweetness by choosing the liquid your fruit is packed in: fruit juice, light syrup, or heavy syrup. I prefer heavy syrup for this peach sorbet.
- If desired, add 1-2 tablespoons of maple syrup, sugar, or other sweetener to the peach mixture before freezing. Keep in mind that sweetness typically diminishes somewhat after freezing.
- Feel free to add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to the mixture before freezing, which can help to brighten the flavors a bit.
