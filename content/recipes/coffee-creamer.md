## Ingredients

1 ¼ cup heavy cream
1 cup whole milk
⅓ cup pure maple syrup
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

Combine cream, milk, and maple syrup in a small pot set over medium heat. Stir together until bubbles start forming around the edges of the pot and mixture is hot and steamy. Remove pot from heat and blend in vanilla. Allow to cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes before transferring to a jar or bottle. Cover and store in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.

## Notes

- Feel free to adjust the milk-to-cream ratio if you prefer your Vanilla Coffee Creamer lighter or richer, as long as the total amount (2 ¼ cups) remains the same.
- You may substitute all half-and-half in place of the heavy cream + milk if you prefer equal ratios of each.
- For neutral flavor, use a light maple syrup (such as grade A golden or amber). You may tweak the amount of maple syrup (more or less) depending on how sweet you like your coffee.
- Agave syrup may be substituted for maple syrup.
- If you are bothered by the skin that forms on top of the creamer while it sits at room temperature, you may strain the creamer through a fine mesh sieve before storing.
- The nutrition estimates on this recipe card are based on dividing this recipe into 12 (approximately 3 ½ Tablespoon) servings. Or if you prefer less creamer in your coffee, this recipe will yield 16 (approximately 2 ½ Tablespoon) servings.
